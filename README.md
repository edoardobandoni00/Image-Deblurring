# Image-Deblurring

This project focuses on solving the image deblurring problem, modelling it as a convolution between a Point Spread Function (PSF) and the image. By reducing the problem to a mean square error minimisation, the conjugate gradient method is applied to solve it.

The focus of the project regard a multiplication between Toeplitz matrices and the image. By exploiting the properties of Toeplitz matrices, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to perform this multiplication efficiently. This implementation integrates the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, Rader's algorithm, and cache optimisation techniques for an improved performance.

The project also includes a version that uses NumPyâ€™s built-in FFT function, enabling the deblurring of larger images.
